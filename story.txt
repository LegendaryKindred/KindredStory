Somewhere in the Shadow Isle, Kindred, the name of the embodiment of lamb and wolf, is on the mission for hunting unrested souls. Lamb is always gentle. Wolf in the opposite, is mean and haunting, but only to the preys. 

Actually, wolves are kind and loyal to their lovers. One wolf tends to have one lover during the course of life.

Actually, Actually, wolves are aggressive and will destroy anything  that stands in their way. The alpha wolf is actually MEGA aggressive and is not kind and loyal to anyone. It is his pack of wolves that are loyal to him.
 
Kindred, while a mix of lamb and wolf, leaned more towards the lamb side of himself and was kind and gentle. He was a very friendly face to see in the Shadow Isle. Everybody loved Kindred.
