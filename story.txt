Somewhere in the Shadow Isle, Kindred, the name of the embodiment of lamb and wolf, is on the mission for hunting unrested souls. Lamb is always gentle. Wolf in the opposite, is mean and haunting, but only to the preys. 

Actually, wolves are kind and loyal to their lovers. One wolf tends to have one lover during the course of life.
